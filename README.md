# 🍼Pregnancy-Risk-Prediction

## 📌Overview  
This project uses machine learning to predict pregnancy-related risks based on patient data. The goal is to support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk pregnancies early for timely intervention and improved health outcomes.  
## 🔍Problem Statement  
We want to build a machine learning model which takes in pregnant patients' clinical data and helps healthcare professionals' decision as to whether the pregnancy is high-risk or low-risk, which will lead to better decision making and also help with making targeted treatments, thereby improving patient outcome.
